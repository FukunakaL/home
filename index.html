            First, &ldquo;Kamen Rider&rdquo; is a series about SFX (special effects) that started in 1971. 
            The target audience was mainly young boys, but as years passed, more adult fans also joined as well as girls and women. 
            Every season has different characters, story lines, and themes but what they all have in common is that the characters can transform. 
            All the seasons have a war between good and evil with global implications.

            It has 49 episodes alongside with 4 movies and 4 spin-offs.
